				<h4>Internet Advertising
					Specialist partners with
						High-Profile B&amp;B Innkeeper</h4><br />
				<p>The compelling force behind <strong><span style="color: #660099">
						Inn Strategy</span></strong> is <b>D.R. Peck</b>, online advertising professional and Internet Search engine
						specialist and <b>Wendy Kelts</b>, former Innkeeper of the <a href="http://www.candlelightinn.com">Candlelight Inn</a> in Napa.
				</p>
				<p>D.R. started one of the first-ever Search Engine Optimization (SEO) companies in the world - Green Flash Systems in 1996. In the early years of the worldwide web, 
					Green Flash Systems became one of the leaders in search engine positioning technology. With State Farm Insurance, Barnes &amp; Nobles and eToys as some of their clients,
					they specialized in getting client's web pages to show-up on the first page of the search engines.
				</p>
				<p>As a national speaker for Danny Sullivan's Search Engine Conferences, D.R. gave talks on Internet advertising and search engine optimization.  
					His success in this field earned D.R. the monikor of "Search Engine Manipulator" in the Los Angeles Times business section.
				</p>  
				<p>Over the years, D.R. has managed several Internet Advertising ventures and has sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in online advertising. 
						This experience enables him to evaulate the "Bang for the Buck" worthiness of the hundreds of travel-related web sites looking to sell advertising to Innkeepers and Vacation rentals owners.
				</p>
				<p>Wendy complements D.R.'s online savvy with her experience operating a B&amp;B that was voted a 2007 Top 10 Most Romantic Inn by Iloveinns.com
						and is a 5-star rated B&amp;B on </span><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32766-d125760-Reviews-Candlelight_Inn-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Trip Advisor</span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt"> with
								over 200 guest reviews. </span>
				</p>
				<p>Wendy has served on the Board of Directors of the Professional
						Association of Innkeepers International (PAII). She has also spoken at state and
						national innkeeping conferences, and written for numerous B&amp;B industry publications.
				</p>
				<p>In addition to running a successful inn, Wendy ran
						the </span><a href="http://www.bbinnstitute.com/"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Bed &amp;
							Breakfast Innstitute</span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt"> where she taught 3-day hands-on workshop for aspiring innsitters. </span></p>
				<p>As a result of D.R. &amp; Wendy's partnership, they examined more closely the online directories in which the Candlelight Inn advertised. 
					While re-evaluating which sites were good advertising value, they found <b>over $1500 of annual online advertising that was under-performing</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Seeing that Innstar has not been updated since at least
						2/28/2006 and that INNtelligent has not been updated since 2004 or early 2005, Wendy
						and D.R. figured it was time to create an Internet resource for Innkeepers to manage
						their Internet advertising.
				</p>
				<p>So this is the official announcement of a new company
						Inn Strategy, designed by an innkeeper and an online advertising professional to
						make your life easier.
