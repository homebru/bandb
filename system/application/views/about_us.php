							<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt"><span style="color: #660099">Internet Advertising
								Specialist partners with
									High-Profile B&B Innkeeper</span> </span></strong>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">The compelling force behind <strong><span style="color: #660099">
									Inn Strategy</span></strong> is <b>D.R. Peck</b>, online advertising professional and Internet Search engine
									specialist and <b>Wendy Kelts</b>, former Innkeeper of the <a href="http://www.candlelightinn.com"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Candlelight Inn</a> in Napa.</span>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">D.R. started one of the first-ever Search Engine Optimization (SEO) companies in the world - Green Flash Systems in 1996. In the early years of the worldwide web, 
								Green Flash Systems became one of the leaders in search engine positioning technology. With State Farm Insurance, Barnes & Nobles and eToys as some of their clients,
								they specialized in getting client's web pages to show-up on the first page of the search engines.</span> </p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">As a national speaker for Danny Sullivan's Search Engine Conferences, D.R. gave talks on Internet advertising and search engine optimization.  
								His success in this field earned D.R. the monikor of "Search Engine Manipulator" in the Los Angeles Times business section.</span>  
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">Over the years, D.R. has managed several Internet Advertising ventures and has sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in online advertising. 
									This experience enables him to evaulate the "Bang for the Buck" worthiness of the hundreds of travel-related web sites looking to sell advertising to Innkeepers and Vacation rentals owners. </span>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">Wendy complements D.R.'s online savvy with her experience operating a B&B that was voted a 2007 Top 10 Most Romantic Inn by Iloveinns.com
									and is a 5-star rated &nbsp;B&amp;B&nbsp; on &nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32766-d125760-Reviews-Candlelight_Inn-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Trip Advisor</span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt"> with
											over 200 guest reviews. </span>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">Wendy has served on the Board of Directors of the Professional
									Association of Innkeepers International (PAII). She has also spoken at state and
									national innkeeping conferences, and written for numerous B&B industry publications.
								</span>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">In addition to running a successful inn, Wendy ran
									the </span><a href="http://www.bbinnstitute.com/"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Bed &
										Breakfast Innstitute</span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt"> where she taught 3-day hands-on workshop for aspiring innsitters. </span></p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">As a result of D.R.& Wendy's partnership, they examined more closely the online directories in which the Candlelight Inn advertised. 
								While re-evaluating which sites were good advertising value, they found <b>over $1500 of annual online advertising that was under-performing</b>. 
									</span>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">Seeing that Innstar has not been updated since at least
									2/28/2006 and that INNtelligent has not been updated since 2004 or early 2005, Wendy
									and D.R. figured it was time to create an Internet resource for Innkeepers to manage
									their Internet advertising. </span>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								<span style="font-size: 8pt">So this is the official announcement of a new company
									Inn Strategy, designed by an innkeeper and an online advertising professional to
									make your life easier. </span>
